Hey guys , I am going to start a series of tutorials in which I will show how to create a simple social network using **MEAN stack**.

**MEAN** stands for :- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) , [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) , [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) , [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
The reason I love MEAN is due to the fact that everything is in JavaScript , whether it is the frontend or backend or even the database. Everything being in a single language makes it easy to learn and getting started is very easy too.In Addition to that all these technologies are Open Source , which is always a good thing when it comes to development due to community support. In a nutshell these four technologies are:-

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) :-  It is a schemaless NoSQL database system. MongoDB saves data in binary JSON format which makes it easier to pass data between client and server. In short , now you can save data by passing JavaScript objects  , receive it in objects , and do  JavaScript operations on it . NoSQL means that it is a schema less database where you can store data without having to define what your table or or column would contain or what data-types they would be .We dont even need to define a fixed number of column for our table .

* [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) :- It is lightweight framework used to build web applications in Node. It provides a number of robust features for building single and multi page web application. I will get back to this in more detail , once we start writing our node applications.

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) :-  It is a JavaScript framework developed by Google. It provides some awesome features like the two-way data binding. It is a great framework for writing awesome client sire oriented apps.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) :- It is a server side JavaScript execution environment. It is a platform built on Google Chrome is V8 JavaScript runtime. It helps in building highly scalable and concurrent applications rapidly . It is asynchronous , non-blocking and really fast .

Go ahead and install them on your system , you can find a lot of instructions to do so .
We will be using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) version 1.5.x .Make sure you install **npm** along with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) . It comes bundled with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) , and is a package manager . It will be used to install packages which we will require in our development . It will start making sense when we start coding.

Once all these are installed , you will need a text-editor or IDE , I use **Brackets** for my development , you can use any text-editor or IDE of your choice .I would also recommend installing git and using a repository for your code base . It always better to do so , in case yow want to revert back to some previous point in time (*like a time machine* ). You can also create a repo on [Github](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) . [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) also allows you to make your repo private for free . It helps in case we dont want any one peeking into our code.

I will be assuming that you have little knowledge to JavaScript . If you need little brushing up or start for the first time , it wont be a problem if you have prior knowledge of any programming language . Still you can learn JavaScript from these places

There are a lot of good resources on [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) from beginner level to advanced one.
Once you are done with these , we can move to Second part of our  tutorials series . In the next post I will be creating the file structure for our application and write a simple hello world program.
For comments , questions , and feedback send me an [email](mailto:me@rishabh1403.com) or leave a comment below . Thanks, Happy Coding !!!

After that came the cool-down period, and one fine day, out of the blue, everyone decided to take a company trip for 2 days. Before we could let it sink, Shubham was ready with the itinerary and cost estimation. The very same weekend we left for Pangot, again in the mountains where you don't even get cellular networks(that was the best part).","categories":["life","travel"],"date":"March 20th, 2020","shortDate":"Mar 20th","year":"2020","path":"posts/life/2020/03/pangot-trip","draft":false},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read"}}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mussoorie Trip","description":"In November I got another opportunity to travel and spend a fine weekend at Mussoorie.

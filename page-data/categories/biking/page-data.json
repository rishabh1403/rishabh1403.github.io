It wasn't very long to be honest, just 682kms round trip, but for me, this was the longest I've ever ridden a bike. The date we finalized was 9th-10th November'19 and the destination was Lansdowne. It is a nice quiet place in the middle of nowhere on a hilltop. Where there is a hill, we must take bikes.

I think this is the best I can describe that journey. My first solo trip,  my first trip in fact. I had never traveled before just for the fun of it. Every place I had visited earlier was either for work or family obligations. This was my first trip for fun, for leisure, for me.

After that came the cool-down period, and one fine day, out of the blue, everyone decided to take a company trip for 2 days. Before we could let it sink, Shubham was ready with the itinerary and cost estimation. The very same weekend we left for Pangot, again in the mountains where you don't even get cellular networks(that was the best part).","categories":["life","travel"],"date":"March 20th, 2020","shortDate":"Mar 20th","year":"2020","path":"posts/life/2020/03/pangot-trip","draft":false},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read"}}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mussoorie Trip","description":"In November I got another opportunity to travel and spend a fine weekend at Mussoorie.

It wasn't very long to be honest, just 682kms round trip, but for me, this was the longest I've ever ridden a bike. The date we finalized was 9th-10th November'19 and the destination was Lansdowne. It is a nice quiet place in the middle of nowhere on a hilltop. Where there is a hill, we must take bikes.

I think this is the best I can describe that journey. My first solo trip,  my first trip in fact. I had never traveled before just for the fun of it. Every place I had visited earlier was either for work or family obligations. This was my first trip for fun, for leisure, for me.

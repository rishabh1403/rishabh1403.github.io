The event was a grim reminder — <em>if you're not paying for it, you are the product</em>.</p>\n<p>In the light of it, a lot of organizations, government and private, have come forward to enforce the right to data privacy. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is one such initiative. Seen those \"cookie warning\" pop-ups on some of the websites recently? That's because of a GDPR directive. Now cookies might sound such a benign, sweet, melt-in-the-mouth kind of word and one could argue that nothing bad can come out of it.. ever! But one would be wrong.

And the information about everything you do there is collected and disseminated among the highest bidders who, then, set up hoardings across the town in an attempt to lure you to their shopping outlet. </p>\n<p>This is how the advertising networks operate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Advertising and tracking networks use tracking cookies to track you across the web. When you visit website that uses scripts from an advertising network, that network can set a cookie in your browser. When you visit another website that uses tracking scripts from the same network, the advertising network can check the value of your cookie – it knows the same person visited both websites. In this way, the advertising networks track you across the web.

The latest release of Safari will block out any malicious trackers. Firefox already comes incorporated with <strong>\"Tracking Protection\"</strong> on both mobile and desktop platforms.</p>\n<p>Apart from the traditional anti-tracking strategy, Firefox is shipping an optional add-on called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/\">Firefox Multi-Account Containers</a>. This enables users to segregate your Facebook activity from the rest of the web.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This extension helps you control more of your web activity from Facebook by isolating your identity into a separate container. This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.

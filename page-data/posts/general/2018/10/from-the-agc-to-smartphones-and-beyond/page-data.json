It operates at 1.4 GHZ and can process instructions at a rate of approximately 1.2 instructions every cycle in each of its 2 cores. Thatâ€™s 3.36 billion instructions per second. Put simply, the iPhone 6â€™s clock is 32,600 times faster than the best Apollo era computers and could perform instructions 120,000,000 times faster. You wouldnâ€™t be wrong in saying an iPhone could be used to guide 120,000,000 Apollo era spacecraft to the moon, all at the same time.

It's only a matter of time before Mars Bar goes from being something you could munch on to a go-to spot for the space tourists.</p>\n<p>But space exploration goes beyond establishing colonies on alien planets and there would be many more challenges further down the line. One of them being the constraints of human body. The limitations of human body will remain the drag in our advance to the deep space and it is difficult to envision human travel beyond a certain threshold. Inventor Ray Kurzweil, offers an interesting solution to this puzzle. </p>\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.mooreslaw.org/\">Moore's Law</a>, if the current trends continue, by 2030 computers would contain the equivalent number of circuits as there are neurons in the human brain. Assuming equivalence, it might just be possible to transfer human consciousness on to a computer chip which can then explore the uncharted territories of the universe, unconstrained by a human body as we know it. It might sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but once upon a time, so did <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/13-everyday-technologies-that-were-first-imagined-in-science-fiction-2012-1?IR=T#laser-guns-2\">space travel, laser beams, and talking machines</a>.</p>\n<p>There you go guys, you made it to end of the post.

There are plenty of other Sci-Fi movies which have shown AR technology. But unlike another Sci-Fi tech like flying cars which have not been realized yet, AR has been around in real life for quite some time, and it is only now that it has finally made its entry in our daily lives.

Augmented Reality, on the other hand, adds to our material surroundings. So how are AR and VR related? The answer is that they are two different concepts on a common spectrum. To understand AR, we have to understand the spectrum.</p>\n<p>Our physical body existing in real space and time is what we perceive as 'reality'.\nVirtual Reality is when we are submerged in a fabricated environment completely different from our own. VR games are the best example where it feels as if the player is in the fantasy game world. Augmented Reality (AR) on the other hand is just what its name suggests, a middle state between the real world and virtual reality. It \"augments\" the \"reality\" adding virtual elements to it.</p>\n<p>In Virtual Reality, you would see a completely different world which requires you to put on special VR glasses. It makes you unaware of your immediate surroundings. However, with Augmented Reality, you don't necessarily have to wear glasses to cut you off from the real world. AR is used to build on to your reality by adding virtual elements to it, as mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>You can think of it as the projection of a video clip on a plane wall like they did in old times. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 644px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/28e1a59f3bd5905b46e796b747bc99db/161f5/project.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.91304347826086%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAv/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAZqdLLhAf//EABsQAAIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEESEi/9oACAEBAAEFAuZJ1+juLeawnnsQo2n/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAbEAACAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRIRJRcf/aAAgBAQAGPwJ7IvnLwatjFKK3qzYn/8QAGxAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFRcbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hf1gXym6cFA06MOCdObejdZ0mCI9fUf/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQkw//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAbEAEAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhQVFhof/aAAgBAQABPxBNd9N6Xeb5GEmU2oHsUAgwLeEqKYEV/Ut0rRXHqx6XJ75H2f/Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"project\"\n        title=\"project\"\n        src=\"/static/28e1a59f3bd5905b46e796b747bc99db/161f5/project.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/28e1a59f3bd5905b46e796b747bc99db/afcd2/project.jpg 300w,\n/static/28e1a59f3bd5905b46e796b747bc99db/82472/project.jpg 600w,\n/static/28e1a59f3bd5905b46e796b747bc99db/161f5/project.jpg 644w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Only AR is more detailed in the sense that it has all the elements of your real surroundings but it adds extra images and information to help you. For example, you are traveling to a foreign country and come across a beautiful monument but you don't know its name. You can just point your phone camera towards it and an app based on AR might tell you the details about the monument. Or, if you're off to buy groceries and the signs are in the native language which you don't understand, there are AR based translation apps available which will translate these signboards in real-time for you.</p>\n<p>These are only a few among a whole range of use-cases of AR-based tech. We'll discuss more in a bit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-did-ar-come-from\"><a href=\"#where-did-ar-come-from\" aria-label=\"where did ar come from permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where did AR come from?</h3>\n<p>As high tech as it might sound, AR has existed for a long time. In 1965, Ivan Sutherland proposed an \"ultimate display\" which was realized in 1968. It was a big \"head-mounted display\" (HMD) which was so heavy it had to be hung from the ceiling on the user's head.

Just getting the hang of it and posting some random thoughts.\nWell technically speaking it's not my first blog. I have tried starting a blog many times before, say around 5 times or so; and boy I have failed, miserably. Every single time I used to sit down, try to search for a platform for days, finalize on a theme for another couple of days and by the time I had everything setup and a couple of blogs posted, I found myself out of energy and will to write anymore. Maybe I was running after the idea of writing a blog to earn a lot of money. I guess it was too naive of me to assume that money would just start pouring from day one. Maybe I was running after recognition, I guess it was too naive of me to assume that I would start generating huge traffic from first hour. Enough whining, I started blogs in past with different goals. Didn't work out, no issues. New goal.</p>\n<h1 id=\"whats-the-plan\"><a href=\"#whats-the-plan\" aria-label=\"whats the plan permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What's the plan</h1>\n<p>Unlike last time, and before that, and so on I do have a stable day job, no monetization needed from blog. Recognition, umm.. not sure if I really want that anymore. Don't get me wrong, I do like making new friends and connections, but that is not the sole motivation anymore. So why start a blog? Well I am software developer by day and freelancer during night, so I hardly get to write at all!!! Recently I also started reading books, (yeah wasn't doing that till now) and I like it. So I thought why not start writing again, whatever I can, whenever I can. I have read that writing improves your ( pardon my lack of word ) <em>writing</em> skills. So that's my motivation here, to improve my skills, sounds fair ?</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-would-i-post\"><a href=\"#what-would-i-post\" aria-label=\"what would i post permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What would I post</h1>\n<p>Umm... General random thoughts, I do some coding at work, so will post some tutorials and articles on various tech topics. At this point I am not really sure what would be the scope of articles, but general random stuff + tech is what I have in mind as of now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-you-done\"><a href=\"#are-you-done\" aria-label=\"are you done permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Are you done?</h2>\n<p>Won't bore you anymore.

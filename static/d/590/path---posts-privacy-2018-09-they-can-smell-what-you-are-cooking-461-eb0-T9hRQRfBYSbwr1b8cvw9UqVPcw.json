The event was a grim reminder — <em>if you're not paying for it, you are the product</em>.</p>\n<p>In the light of it, a lot of organizations, government and private, have come forward to enforce the right to data privacy. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is one such initiative. Seen those \"cookie warning\" pop-ups on some of the websites recently? That's because of a GDPR directive. Now cookies might sound such a benign, sweet, melt-in-the-mouth kind of word and one could argue that nothing bad can come out of it.. ever! But one would be wrong.

And the information about everything you do there is collected and disseminated among the highest bidders who, then, set up hoardings across the town in an attempt to lure you to their shopping outlet. </p>\n<p>This is how the advertising networks operate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Advertising and tracking networks use tracking cookies to track you across the web.

The latest release of Safari will block out any malicious trackers.

This enables users to segregate your Facebook activity from the rest of the web.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This extension helps you control more of your web activity from Facebook by isolating your identity into a separate container.
